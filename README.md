Javascript Tic Tac Toe Game

Our super awesome javascript tic tac toe game. Go to johnnyfuchs.github.io to play!

##Steps to get set up:

1. Create an account on [github](https://www.github.com) (you're probably there right now). **Remember your username and password!**

2. Install [git](http://git-scm.com/download/mac). This is the tool we use for making changes and sharing our code.

3. Follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) for connecting your github account to your computer. In short:
  * Open up the `Terminal` application. Either by typing `cmd+[space]` and searching for it, or by going to you `Applications` folder and opening it from there.
  * Type the following command in the terminal, replacing `"YOUR NAME"` with... your name. This will appear next to all changes you make to your code. Hit enter to execute the command. Then, as a separate command, configure your email the same way.
```bash
  git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
  git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
```
 4. Now we need to create a `repository` to save our code to. This is basically a folder with all our project code in it that can be quickly copied between computers and the "cloud". :cloud: Follow the instructions [here](https://pages.github.com/). These instructions are better than anything I could write. ;)
